# Walmart-Retail-Sales-Forecasting-
"Time series analysis of Walmart sales data with trends, seasonality, breakdowns, and simple forecasting."
# 🛒 Time Series Breakdown of Retail Sales

This project analyzes Walmart’s retail sales data (Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting dataset) 
using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels)** to identify **trends, seasonality, and forecasting patterns**.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Analyze retail dataset with monthly sales
- Plot **trends, moving averages, and seasonal patterns**
- Break down revenue by **product (Dept)** and **region (Store)**
- Visualize sales patterns over time
- Bonus: Build simple forecasts using **rolling mean** and **Holt-Winters exponential smoothing**

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `data/` → raw + processed data files
- `notebooks/` → Google Colab Jupyter Notebook
- `reports/` → summary report and plots
- `README.md` → project overview
- `requirements.txt` → dependencies

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels
- Scikit-learn (for evaluation metrics)

## 📊 Key Insights
- Clear **monthly sales trends** observed
- Strong **seasonal effects** (holiday spikes, recurring monthly patterns)
- Top 5 **Departments** and **Stores** contribute majority of revenue
- Holt-Winters forecasting provides better accuracy than naive rolling mean
